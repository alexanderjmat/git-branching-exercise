Answers Part I

git branch branchname
Fast-forward merges are when git can easily parse commit timelines and chronologically organize them. Recursive merge is an algorithm that is used when fastforward merging wont work
git checkout branchname
git branch -d branchname
Merge conflicts happen when the same file is changed from two different branches. git wont know which one to merge
